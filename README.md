    A unofficial plugin to keep your watched movie history from Jellyfin automatically updated to your Letterboxd diary.
</p>

## About

This plugin sends daily updates to the Letterboxd diary informing the films watched on Jellyfin. Since the Letterboxd API is not publicly available, this project uses the HtmlAgilityPack package to interact directly with the website's interface.

## Installation

1. Open the dashboard in Jellyfin, then select `Catalog` and open `Settings` at the top with the `⚙️` button.

2. Click the `+` button and add the repository URL below, naming it whatever you like and save.

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hrqmonteiro/jellyfin-plugin-letterboxd-sync/master/manifest.json
```

3. Go back to `Catalog`, click on 'LetterboxdSync' at 'General' group and install the most recent version.

4. Restart Jellyfin and go back to the plugin settings. Go to `My Plugins` and click on 'LetterboxdSync' to configure.
   
## Configure

 - You can associate one Letterboxd account for each Jellyfin user. You need click `Save` for each one.

 - The synchronization task runs every 24 hours and only for uses accounts marked as `Enable`.

 - Check `Send Favorite` if you want films marked as favorites on Jellyfin to be marked as favorites on Letterboxd.

 - By default the plugin will do a full sync to letterboxd. Once done initially its advised to `Enable Date Filtering` with a short lookback to avoid load on letterboxd.

## Add raw cookies (In case you are getting 403 Error when authenticating)

If you try to authenticate and receive a 403 error:

<p align="center">
    <img src="/images/config-page-403-error.png" width="70%">
</p>

That means Cloudflare is preventing you logging in. To bypass this, you need to log in letterboxd in a browser and copy the cookies from the request headers,
which is usually the first request on the page.

So activate Developer Tools in your browser (usually F12) and go to the Network tab:

<p align="center">
    <img src="/images/readme-request.png" width="70%">
</p>

Reload the page and click on the first request (on "/"), like the image, and scroll below until the request headers and you will see the Cookie:

<p align="center">
    <img src="/images/readme-request-headers.png" width="70%">
</p>

Be sure to right click and click on `Copy value`, just selecting with your mouse will not work.

Then paste that into the Raw Cookies section in the Plugin settings:

</p>

That should bypass the Cloudflare protection and allow you to login.
